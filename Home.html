                            The future of a country will depend on the
                            children living today. If the children are
                            directed correctly, educated, and cared well
                            today, the country’s future will flourish.
                            So, our responsibility today is to educate
                            and protect the children well, but that is
                            not what is happening today. If the majority
                            of children give up education and do jobs
                            with their parents, their lives will not be
                            secure.

                            Community Base child protection program’s
                            aim is to protect children. Here they
                            concentrate on children in coastal areas
                            and in tea estates. Instead of keeping
                            the children in Children’s Homes, the
                            project will try to achieve the
                            objectives by visiting communities
                            where they are, that is the villages and
                            developing them with the help of the
                            village community. To develop the
                            children, first their families must be
                            uplifted economically.  Therefore, under
                            this project, they provide skill
                            training for the parents of the children
                            to empower the parents, and seek the
                            assistance of the Police in the area,
                            Grama Sevaka, and the AG office in order
